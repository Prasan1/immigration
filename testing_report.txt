✅ FIXED - 1. Team management route is not enabled. Clicking on the Team Management button on Quick Action section of the dashboard is failing
   → Added /team/dashboard route in team_routes.py

✅ FIXED - 2. Favicon icon is missing and not consistent acros all tabs and routes
   → Added favicon.svg to all key templates (dashboard, passport, cover letter, i94, team, enterprise, auth)

✅ FIXED - 3. Immigrationforms.io should be removed from the page as this domain is not what we have We have www.immigrationtemplates.com therefore
   we need to focus on this name instead.
   → Changed default site_name to "Immigration Templates" in app.py
   → All page titles now use {{ g.branding.site_name }}

All issues resolved! Ready for deployment to immigrationtemplates.com
